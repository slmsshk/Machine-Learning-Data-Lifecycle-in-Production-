# Machine-Learning-Data-Lifecycle-in-Production-
Week 1 Assignment: Data Validation
Examining the characteristics of your data is an important part of building a production-grade machine learning system. Improving data quality will help drive your model's performance by detecting possible issues such as malformed values, distribution skew, and unfair bias. In this week's assignment, you will be performing common data validation steps to examine the Diabetes dataset. This includes:

* Generating and visualizing statistics

* Inferring and updating a dataset schema

* Detecting, visualizing, and fixing anomalies

* Examining slices of the dataset

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GRADING:

Please submit your work after placing your solutions in the exercises of the assignment (i.e. replacing the None placeholders) and saving the notebook. 

Remember that you can submit your work even if you are not done with the whole assignment by using the partial grading feature explained in the previous reading item.

To use this feature include the comment # grade-up-to-here in the last cell that you wish to be evaluated and subsequent cells will be omitted from the grading process. This way you can know if you are on the right track before finishing the whole assignment. 

When resuming, remember to delete the comment since the grader automatically filters out all of the cells after the first time it encounters it.

This is to ensure proper grading of your submission. For more tips, please join Discourse as mentioned here and see this thread.
